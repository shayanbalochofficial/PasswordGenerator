# Password Generator

This `Password Generator` is a sleek, web-based tool built with Python and Streamlit, designed to create random, secure passwords in seconds. Customize your password length and choose whether to include digits or special charactersâ€”all with an easy-to-use interface! No more struggling to come up with strong passwords for your accounts.

## Features

- **Adjustable Length**: Choose a password length between 8 and 24 characters using a handy slider.
- **Customizable Options**:
  - Include digits (0-9) for added complexity.
  - Add special characters (!@#$%^&*) for extra security.
- **Default Characters**: Uses all letters (a-z, A-Z) as the base character set.
- **Interactive Web App**: Powered by Streamlit, runs in your browser with a clean, responsive design.
- **Instant Results**: Generate and view your password with a single click.

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.7 or higher recommended).
